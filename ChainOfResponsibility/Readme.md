After a day’s work by the agents in the above example, a large number of processed requests get stored in the database. Each night, 3 backend processes will start working on the data sequentially. The first one (Validator) will check if a request has the valid contact information provided (email, phone and address) and then separates the valid from the invalid ones. The invalid requests will be saved in a ‘discarded-requests’ file. The valid ones will be passed to the second process (Data Washer). 
The Data Washer will do some analysis on each request and generate sales leads before passing them to the third/last process, called Reporter. What the Reporter does is simply generate a report (sales leads) by State where the customer lives. 
Design the application with the CoR pattern. You also create a ‘client’ program that sends call records to the Validator one by one, which checks if it is a valid one (to make it simple, we take all records that have non-empty address, phone and email as valid ones). Then the Validator sets the record’s ‘isValid’ field to true or leaves it as false accordingly before sending it to the Data Washer. The Data Washer sets the record’s ‘isASalesLead’ field to true before passing it to the Reporter. The Reporter simply generates a report for all the sales leads. You can use the following skeleton code in your implementation.
