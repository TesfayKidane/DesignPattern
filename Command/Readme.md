Design/implement a simple program with Command Pattern, which creates, scales, and moves a square by issuing commands. For example, ‘Create 5’ will create a 5x5 square; ‘Scale 2’ will make the sides of a square twice as long; ‘Move right 3’ will move the position of a square to the right by 3, etc. Your program should also support ‘undo’ to cancel a previous operation/command.
